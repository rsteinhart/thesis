all you would need to do is change the config file
it’s currently:
export GRIB_DIR=/Users/ewicksteed/Desktop/2019082700/grib_files
export OUT_DIR=/Users/ewicksteed/Desktop/2019082700/ens_files
but you would need to change it to your path to wherever you have the folder with the data: 2019082700
then you don’t need to create other directories for output, the script should create them for you just have the 
script and the config file in the same directory
to run the script first do chmod u+x make_ens.sh 
this allows the script to be executable

then ./make_ens.sh to run the script
